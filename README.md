Given data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/food-ordering-and-delivery-app-dataset/code

	Food_order.csv


Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Check for and handle missing values.
Ensure data types are appropriate for analysis.
Remove duplicates if any.

Descriptive Statistics:
	Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for numerical columns like cost, rating, preparation time, and delivery time.
	Frequency counts for categorical columns like restaurant name, cuisine type, and day of the week.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	Visualize the distribution of numerical features using histograms or box plots.
	Visualize the distribution of categorical features using bar charts.
 
Correlation Analysis:
	Analyze the correlation between numerical features using a heatmap.
	Check if there are any relationships between ratings, cost, preparation time, and delivery time.

Group By Analysis:
	Group by cuisine type to find the average cost, rating, preparation time, and delivery time.
	Group by day of the week to see if there are patterns in orders or delivery times.
 
Advanced Analysis:
	Perform time series analysis if the data spans over a significant period.
	Use clustering to group similar restaurants or cuisines.
 
Visualization:
	Create scatter plots to visualize relationships between features.
	Use bar plots to compare average ratings or costs across different cuisine types.
	Use line plots to show trends over days of the week.

Hypothesis Testing:
	Perform statistical tests to check if the differences observed in the group by analysis are statistically significant.
